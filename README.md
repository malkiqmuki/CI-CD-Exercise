This repository demonstrates CI/CD concepts and automation.

---

## 📖 Description
This repository demonstrates core concepts of **Continuous Integration (CI)** and **Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD)**.  
The goal is to show:
- How to automatically build and test a project  
- How to use **GitHub Actions** (or another pipeline tool)  
- How to implement a good workflow for team collaboration  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **GitHub Actions** – automating builds and tests  
- **Node.js / Java / Python** – (replace with your project language)  
- **Docker** – (optional, for containerization)  
- **Unit/Integration Tests** – to validate functionality  
- **GitHub** – for version control and CI/CD pipeline  

---

## 🚀 How It Works
1. **CI Steps:**
   - Install dependencies  
   - Run unit tests  
   - Check code style and quality (linting)  
2. **CD Steps (if any):**
   - Build the project  
   - Deploy to a test environment  
   - (Optional) Automatic deployment to production

## 🔍 Example GitHub Actions Workflow
```yaml
name: CI Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

jobs:
  build-and-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: "18"

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
